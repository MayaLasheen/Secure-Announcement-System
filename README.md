# Secure-Announcement-System
<p align= "justify">The project is implemented in VHDL on 2 Basys3 boards. The first board (FPGA_1) is responsible for
the text input (using the keyboard), encryption and transmission, while the second board (FPGA_2) is responsible for receiving, decryption and text display.
The ecryption and decryption of the 128-bit announcement was performed using Advanced Encryption
Standard (AES).</p>
